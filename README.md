This repository contains my practice records and notes as I prepare for the OSCP exam. 

Some of the challenges are represented by screenshots that make sense to me during the learning process. 
These images and notes are part of my personal study and are meant to capture my understanding of various techniques and tools used in penetration testing.

Feel free to browse through, but please note that the content is tailored to my learning journey and may not follow formal documentation or methodologies. 
This is simply my way of organizing key concepts and practical examples for my exam preparation.
