This repository contains my practice records and notes as I prepare for the OSCP exam. 

Some of the challenges are represented by screenshots that make sense to me during the learning process. 

These are part of my personal study & are meant to capture my understanding of various techniques and tools used in penetration testing.

The content is tailored to my learning journey and may not follow formal documentation or methodologies.
